# WSUHackathon2015 Kinect Controller

There will be a better description for this project someday. This project will also be worked on further it is not complete at all.
But homework for school and work can make it a bit difficult to have free time for programming on side projects.

# Description

This project was meant to be a Kinect controller that would recognize gestures and simulate keyboard and mouse input.
It only supports Windows because of the Kinect SDK (which I believe only supports Windows.)
It's biggest feature is that it is data driven. Depending on the config file given to the program, there will be
different gestures that trigger different keyboard/mouse inputs.

Later I'll give a tutorial on how to setup the configuration file.
