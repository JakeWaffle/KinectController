# Kinect Controller

## Description

This project's goal is to make the Kinect compatible with any possible video game on a computer. The idea behind it is that the user supplies a
configuration file that defines the gestures that the Kinect Controller will observe. These gestures will be tied to one or many reactions that
have the potential to do a lot of different things from emulating keyboard events to executing programs or macros.

After this project gets some headway and we reach a near 1.0 release, then there should be a good amount of configuration
files already created for various games and applications of the project.

## Building the Project

The project isn't ready for use yet. The minimum features are still being worked on for the project to actually do what
it is supposed to do. There is however a working prototype in the 'prototype' branch. The prototype isn't being maintained
at this point and is in the process of being replaced with the final version.

Eventually Gradle will be paired with InstallBuilder in order to build the required Jars and install them in a 
friendly manner. InstallBuilder should be freely available since this is an open source project.
