/*
This program is called "Kinect Controller". It is meant to detect gestures with the Kinect
and then simulate keyboard and/or mouse input. The configuration files used by this program are
not intended to be under the following license.

The Kinect Controller makes use of the J4K library and Esper and we have done
nothing to change their source.

By using J4K we are required to site their research article:
A. Barmpoutis. 'Tensor Body: Real-time Reconstruction of the Human Body and Avatar Synthesis from RGB-D',
IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, Special issue on Computer Vision for RGB-D Sensors: Kinect and Its
Applications, October 2013, Vol. 43(5), Pages: 1347-1356.

By using Esper without their commercial license we are also required to release our software under
a GPL license.
